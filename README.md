# Bike-sharing-analysis

### Problem statement
To estimate the demands of bicycles in a bike sharing scheme based on predictors like weather, time and date. Data set used in this exercise contains hourly rental spanning two years

### Motivaions
To better forecast bike rental demands for bike companies to strategize & maximize profits

### Analysis of results
Observations: 
- Regularized regression model did not shrink any predictors completely to 0 hence showing significance of all the selected predictors
- Results derived from the model complements the actual bike sharing behaviour

Intepretation of predictors:
- Increased bike usage is observed when temperature is in the range of 15 to 25 degrees Celsius
- Increased bike usage is observed during working days as compared to a non working day
- Higher Demand for bike is observed during  morning & evening peak hours. This might be in relation to the office timings in a day
- Increased ridership on 2012 relative to 2011. From observation, we note the  increase in demand for bike sharing 
- As humidity increased above 40%, the bike usage drops gradually.

### For Improvement
- Data set with extended duration beyond 2012 could help get more updated results for better insights
- Information from other modes of transport could be included to study commutersâ€™ behavior
- Demographic level data could be included for more insights
- Longitude & Latitude coordinate could be included to optimize bike deployment
